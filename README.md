# esp32-scheme-vm

A Scheme interpreter to be used both on a linux based host and on an ESP32 IOT processor.

Early piece of code. This is work in progress and is still under heavy development.
At this point in time, programs are able to be run on both Linux, OSX and ESP32
platforms. Please look at the Todo list below for more information about the state
of development.

This is a port of the PicoBit Scheme system you can find at the following
[location](https://github.com/stamourv/picobit).

The ESP32 processor provides an environment that requires a lot of changes to
the way the scheme vm operate. As such, I decided to develop a new interpreter
from scratch, using as much as possible from the PicoBit vm implementation.

A major aspect of this decision is related to the relocation of the code space
constants, ram, rom and vector heaps to be managed through C vector such that
addresses calculation is done through GCC instead of being manipulated manually
through the code. Indexing RAM heap from index 0 requires the relocation of
ROM space and small numbers/booleans constants in the higher portion of the
address space.

RAM and ROM data spaces are accessed with indexes in separate vectors. The
address space is divided in three zone:

  * 0x0000 - 0xDFFF: RAM Space
  * 0xE000 - 0xFDFF: ROM Space
  * 0xFE00 - 0xFFFF: Coded small ints, true, false and ()

Each ROM and RAM data cell is composed of 5 bytes. Please look at file
inc/vm-arch.h for details regarding the vm architecture. As the address space
architecture is different than the original PicoBit, small changes were
required to the picobit compiler in support of this setup (file assembler.rkt).

The code produced by the compiler is accessed through a separate vector.
Code addresses start at 0x0000 and are byte addressable.

esp32-scheme-vm is released under the GPLv3.

3. Third priorities

     and 32 bits address boundaries

## Todo for the compiler

1. As first priorities to get something working with the interpreter

   * Little-Endian **OK**
   * ROM Heap space (for constants) start at virtual address 0xE000 **OK**

   * Enlarge the ROM heap space (from the maximum of 256 ROM constants)
   * Add version numbering in code (Major + Minor numbers)

## Installation

Here are the steps to get a development environment that will allow
for both host (linux or OSX) and ESP32 scheme programming with this PicoBit
implementation (A Microsoft Windows context of development will eventually be
documented):

1. Install the development tools:

   * ESP-IDF - As per the ESP-IDF Installation guidelines at that
    [location](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/linux-setup.html)
     for Linux, or that
     [location](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/macos-setup.html) for OSX.

   * GCC and other tools - As per your OS environment. The following products
     are required: **GCC, gawk, git, doxygen**

   * DrRacket from that [location](http://racket-lang.org/).

2. Download the esp32-scheme-vm from github

   * From a terminal screen, goto a folder into which this repository will
     be retrieved in.

   * execute the following command:

    ```
      $ git clone https://github.com/turgu1/esp32-scheme-vm.git
    ```

3. Compile the host version of the compiler, picobit-vm and hex2bin programs.

   * Do the following commands in a terminal screen:

    ```
      $ cd esp32-scheme-vm
      $ make
      $ cd hex2bin
      $ make
      $ cd ..
    ```

4. Prepare your scheme program. A demonstration program named "fibo.scm" is
supplied that compute the Fibonacci value for the 200 first numbers of the
Fibonacci suite. You can compile it and run it with the following commands:

    ```
      $ ./picobit fibo.scm
      $ ./picobit-vm fibo.hex
    ```

5. Compile and run the program on a ESP32 platform. For this, you will need
an ESP32 electronic circuit **hooked to you computer through an USB serial port**.
The author uses a ESP-WROOM-32 development board (Nodemcu) similar to the
one offered by [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-ESP-WROOM-32-Development-Microcontroller-Integrated/dp/B0718T232Z/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515534535&sr=8-1&keywords=esp32+nodemcu). The example here will use the
fibo.scm program compiled in the preceding step.

   * Configure ESP-IDF to identify the USB port on which the development board is
     connected. Use the following command:

     ```
       $ make -f Makefile.esp32 menuconfig
     ```

   * The application fibo.scm is already compiled. We need to create a binary
     version of it through the following command:

     ```
       $ ./h2b fibo.hex fibo.bin
     ```

   * The resulting fibo.bin file must be made available to picobit-vm as it
     will be integrated with the virtual machine code and pushed on the ESP32:

     ```
       $ cp fibo.bin main/program.bin
     ```

   * Now, we compile and burn the code on the ESP32. The first time picobit-vm
     will be built for the ESP32, it will take sometime as the entire ESP-IDF
     environment will also be compiled:

     ```
       $ make -f Makefile.esp32 flash
     ```

   * At this point, the program is now on the ESP32 platform. You can monitor
     the resulting output using the following command:

     ```
       $ make -f Makefile.esp32 monitor
     ```

# Original PicoBit Readme file

This is a very small Scheme system designed to run on small
microcontrollers, currently PIC18 and ARM.

It consists of

* a bytecode compiler which compiles Scheme source code to bytecode.
  The bytecode compiler is run using Racket, usually on a
  PC/workstation.

* a bytecode interpreter which can be either compiled to run on a
  microcontroller, or to be run on some common operating systems, at
  least GNU/Linux (Windows support hasn't been tested in a while,
  though, and especially the networking part might not work out of the
  box). It is written in (mostly) portable C.


## USAGE:

1. Install Racket (needed to run the bytecode compiler)
     racket-lang.org

2. Build the VM:
     make
 This will build the VM with the default configuration (workstation,
 no debugging). To configure the VM for another architecture, or with
 different options, run
     make help
 from the `vm' directory.

Note: gawk is required to build the VM.

2. Compile a Scheme program:
     ./picobit prog.scm

3. Run the resulting program:
     ./picobit-vm prog.hex

Note: The `p' script is a shortcut for compiling and running programs:
     ./p prog.scm
 is equivalent to
     ./picobit prog.scm ; ./picobit-vm prog.hex
