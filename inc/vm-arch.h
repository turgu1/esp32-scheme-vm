/** VM Architecture Definition.

  The Virtual Machine definition is composed of the following elements:

    
    Cells definitions
    VM Registers
    Machine instructions

 */

/** Cells Definitions.

  Every cell is 40 bits long (5 bytes). To get good memory compaction, the following
  option must be user for gcc:

     -fpack-struct=1

  On the ESP32, alignement doesn't seems to have any issue on the performance
  of the code. At least sequential RAM access runs at the same speed even when 16 bits words
  are accessed. 

  ToDo: Random access remains to be checked

  The address space of the heap cannot go beyond (64k * 5). To address 128K cells,
  we need 16 bits (2Ë†16 = 64k).

  - The 2 first bit are 0
  - The 4 following bits are the type of a cell
  - The 2 following bits are the GC bits
  - The rest of the cell depends of the type of cell

  We define the following cells:

   cons

      CAR and CDR are indexes in the heap

      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
      | 00 | 0000 | GC |      CAR      |       CDR      |
      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+

         2     4     2                 32

   bignum

      A Bignum is composed of a list of 16 bits signed numerical parts, least 
      significant portion is first.

      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
      | 00 | 1001 | GC |    NUM PAR    |      NEXT      |

         2     4     2        16               16

   string

      A string is a list of 2 chars cells and is located in RAM in the heap. If it is composed of
      an odd numner of chars, the last one is null. A zero length string
      will have the two chars = 0

      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
      | 00 | 1010 | GC |   2  CHARS    |      NEXT      |
      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
         2     4     2        16               16

  cstring

      A constant string is a null terminated string located in the ROM space, in the
      cstring pool.

      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
      | 00 | 1011 | GC |  CHARS LST    |       0        |
      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
         2     4     2        16               16

   vector

      Lenght is in bytes (max 64k). To content the index
      (4 bytes aligned) in the vector space.

      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
      | 00 | 1100 | GC |    LENGTH     |   TO CONTENT   |
      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
         2     4     2        16               16

   symbol

      The Symbol table is in the rom area. The char list is an index (byte index in
      the constant string pool) to a null terminated string containing the human 
      representation of the symbol. Next point to the next synbol cell in the 
      symbol table. The chars list pointer in unique for each symbol.

      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
      | 00 | 1101 | GC |   CHARS LST   |       NEXT     |
      +----+------+----+---------------+----------------+
