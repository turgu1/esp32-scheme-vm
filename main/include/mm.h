/** Memory management.

   The VM Architecture, in relation with the capability offered
   with the ESP32 requiers the following memory types:

    - RAM Heap space
    - RAM Vector space
    - ROM Heap space
    - ROM Vector space

   The RAM spaces are dynamically managed using the mm module functions
   described below. The ROM spaces are considered static and cannot be
   modified in any way. They are provided with the esp32-scheme-vm
   program in support of the various scheme structures embedded with the
   vm.

  /**
     RAM and ROM heaps are combined in a "virtual" heap through the indices in use.
     RAM indices start at 0 and end with the size of available contiguous allocatable
     space from the ESP-IDF. ROM indices start at 0xE000 up to the lenght of the ROM
     cells array.  The maximum indice to access ROM must be lower than
     65536 - 512: 0xFE00.
